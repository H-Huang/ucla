# Add yourself as participant

If this is your first Open Source contribution â€“ welcome ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ðŸŽŠ

No coding skills are required and you can do so right from your browser.
The only requirement is that you are signed in to your [GitHub account](github.com/join).

## 1. Create a new file in the `_posts/` directory

- In your browser, open the [`_posts/` folder of this eventâ€™s repository](https://github.com/welcome-to-open-source/ucla/tree/master/_posts).
- Click the "Create new file" button. You should now see an empty text editor.
- In the text input "Name your file..." enter `2017-02-25-{your github username}.md`,
  where `{your github username}` is your GitHub username. So for example, if your
  username is `sam0815`, then enter `2017-02-25-sam0815.md`
- Now copy the content below into the big text input

  ```
  ---
  type:     {one of: organizer, mentor, attendee}
  name:     {your name here}
  github:   {github username}
  twitter:  {twitter username without the @, optional}
  website:  {your website, optional}

  {a bio about yourself. Tell us why you are interested in Open Source and what youâ€™d like to contribute}
  ```

  As an example, here is how [Gregorâ€™s file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/welcome-to-open-source/ucla/master/_posts/2017-02-25-gr2m.md) looks like

  ```

  with your actual username :)
- Hit the "Propose new file" button
- On the next page, hit the "Create pull request" button
- ask one of the organizers or mentors to merge your pull request
- Thatâ€™s it! Once merged you will automagically appear on [the eventâ€™s website](https://welcome-to-open-source.github.io/ucla)
